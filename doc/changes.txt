For example ARABIC_LETTER_HAMZA (or ARABIC_LETTER_WAW_WITH_HAMZA_ABOVE) will be matched with itself as well as ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF_WITH_HAMZA_ABOVE, ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF_WITH_HAMZA_BELOW, ARABIC_LETTER_WAW_WITH_HAMZA_ABOVE, and ARABIC_LETTER_YEH_WITH_HAMZA_ABOVE.

For example if user entered ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF (&#1575;), it will be matched with ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF_WITH_HAMZA_ABOVE (&#1650;), ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF_WITH_HAMZA_BELOW (&#1573;), and also <tt>ARABIC_LETTER_ALEF</tt> (&#1575;) itself.

Version 0.6.6 - [6-10-07]
Features/Enhancements:
	A new property added to config.properties for default local machine address. It's 127.0.0.1 by default.
	New language pack: Uzbek (Nurali Abdurahmonov).
	New language packs: Tatar, both Russian (tatar.xml) and Turkish (tatar-tr.xml) transliterations, by Fareed A. Bashirov.
	.exe file creation method enhanced. Launch4J is now used (instead of NSIS) to create launcher win32 executable file. Its size is less than the previous method (~80KB) and it has also a custom process name, zekr.exe instead of javaw.exe.
	zekrc.exe added as a console version of zekr.exe. For using command lines, this file can be used instead of zekr.exe.
	Upgrade to SWT 3.4M2 (version: 3.410). This version has full support for BIDI rendering and mirroring on GTK - Linux.
	Main SWT shell (Quran Form) made BIDI, so "close", "maximize" and "minimize" buttons on Windows will place at the upper-left side of the form. Having this, menu bar is mirrored on Linux for RTL language packs.
	"More..." menu item under recitation menu group, to go to Zekr resource page.
	Sura-aya synchronization button state is now saved and loaded on startup (part of #1793836).
	JW MP3 Player updated to 3.12.
	"Force GC" button is not shown in production-mode releases (detects if debug mode is true, based on GlobalConfig.DEBUG_MODE)

	Alpha channel is supported in AdvancedSplashScreen. It captures central area of the current background in order to emulate opacity for the splash screen.
	Search result font enhancement for Uthman Taha theme.
	Mozilla XULRunner can be used instead of system default browser on all platforms. If XULRunner is installed, one can use it as default browser by setting options.browser.useMozilla property to true (false by default).

       - Next/Previous aya
       - Next/Previous juz
       - Next/Previous hizb quarter
Bug fixes:
	Bookmark sets are now saved by default as UTF-8, fixing the bug which caused bookmarks to save in file.encoding encoding.
	Bug with QuranFormMenuFactory.createOrUpdateBookmarkMenu(), which caused new bookmarks menu to be created fixed.
	Fixing flash loading problem on large suras in Linux, by adding a 100-millisecond timeout to SWF object initialization.
	If flash object is not loaded (either because object loading of the browser is slow, or HTTP server is disabled), no JavaScript error is shown to the user.
	Bug fix for Print CSS for all themes: hiding footerBar for printing.
	Bug fix for suraAyaSign font size in all themes.
	Hizb quarter tooltip text fixed (hizb number was counted incorrectly).
	Hizb quarter is shown for hizb start points (2 locations per juz), with a modified tooltip text (quarter part is now shown).
	One of the most important bugs with Mozilla on Linux (and also Widows XULRuner) fixed. This bug prevented using aya box in nav-bar to change aya within a sura. It also caused aya syncing (automatically focusing on the next aya when one aya is finished) not to work when playing a recitataion in continuous mode. 

Version 0.7.0 beta 1 - [20-3-08]
Features/Enhancements:
	Quran translation verification added in order to verify whether the text is authentic (downloaded from the official website) or not.
		- Each translation (and other signable packs) should have a signature meta data.
		- If the signature is not valid, user will be prompted by a warning message.
		- Translation signature verification is done on demand (when translation is loaded).
    Two new properties introduced for translation descriptors: "version" (translation descriptor file version), and "signature" (digital signature of the translation text).
	Check for update menu item added under Help menu.
	    - It looks up in the update site (update.address property) for any new update available.
	    - QuranForm checks for update on Shell activation if this is time for update (update.checkInterval is passed from update.lastCheck)
	   	- Update info is downloaded in form of an XML file from server. It contains version, build number, release status, download URL, etc.
	    - Check for update action or its menu item can be fully disabled by setting update.enable property to false. This can be helpful when user is always offline or Zekr is used as a Debian package (which should has it's own method of updating).
	A "View log" link added to the about page, which tries to open log. It can be used for technical support.
	Sky theme enhancements:
		- Rounded corner on Mozilla or CSS3-compliant browsers.
		- Sura name on the top of each sura
		- Text-based Bismillah on the top of each Sura (except suras 1 and 9)
	/res/text/metadata directory created. quran-properties.xml and each quran-properties-[lang_iso_id].xml should be under this folder. Quran root list with its addresses is under this folder as well.
	VM info in the log file updated to be more accurate.
	Localization of all numbers in search result messages. 
	Changing sura-aya location to the form: sura#:aya# (e.g. 3:130). It used to be like this: sura#-aya#, which was not correctly rendered for RTL environments.
	Error tolerance for unavailable recitation packs. Will disable audio support, if no other one is available, or use the first recitation as default.
	English translation and transliteration of sura names added to quran-properties.xml.
	Different options for showing sura names: Arabic, English translation, English transliteration, Local translation, or Local transliteration. The last two are available only if quran-properties-xy.xml file was available for selected language (where xy is the language code). view.sura.name property added to config.properties to store user's sura name mode.
	No need to restart application anymore if a new translation is added. Restarting is still needed when application launched with no default translation (hence translation support is disabled until it is restarted).
	Switching to quran-simple Quran text file obtained from tanzil.info. This is an accurate Quran text, which is best for reading Quran. As a result all kinds of Waqf signs are available even in non-Uthmai theme.
	When selecting multi-trans layout, Zekr brings up multi-translations customization form if custom translation list size is zero.
	"Configure Custom translations" menu item, moved under View > Translation menu.
	A new basic (although not so basic) search based on Tanzil.info search algorithm introduced (as a result two view.search.sortOrder, view.search.sortBy and view.search.multiline added to config.properties):
		- The GUI of basic and advanced search is now identical (although there are still two tabs).
		- Sort results by: 1. Natural order, 2. Similarity, 3. Revelation order, and 4. Aya length.
		- Sort order: ascending and descending
		- Wildcards (?, ., *) support.
		- Partial diacritic matching and partial/exact phrase matching.
		- Logical operators (default operator between two phrases is AND) 
	"Revelation order" and "Aya length" sort criteria, as well as the feature to sort results ascending or descending added to Advanced search.
	Quran Revelation order metadata added:
		- revel.default property in config.properties.
		- Revelation data packages are zip files with suffix .revel.zip, containing an ordering data (.revel.txt) file and a revelation descriptor (revelation.properties).
		- Revelation packages may have two modes: sura and aya. If a revel-pack is in sura mode, it should have exactly 114 numbers representing revelation order of 114 Quran suras. In aya mode, it has 6236 numbers representing revelation order of all ayas. Note that non of these are accurate, and revelation order is a debatable topic.
		- Revelation packs are signed so that Zekr can verify authenticity of the package.
	Two new sort order added to Lucene search. Users can sort search results by: 1. Aya length 2. Revelation order (based on the current selected revelation data pack) as well as the previous options(Similarity and Natural order)
	Sorted search results can be ordered ascending or descending both for base search and Lucene search. Two new properties added to config.properties accordingly: view.search.sortOrder and view.search.advanced.sortOrder which accept "asc" and "des" values.
	A new checkbox: "Enable audio support" added to OptionsForm, general tab, to enable or disable audio support. When disabling, it also disables local HTTP server. This item is enable when both audio.enable and server.http.enable are enabled. Otherwise it's disabled.
	lineDelimiter changed to delimiter in translation descriptors. Translation packs should have both lineDelimiter and delimiter in order to be backward compatible.
	Translation packages' suffix changed to .trans.zip (formely .zip).
	Full screen support: a new menu item added under View menu which switches GUI to the full screen mode. It requires SWT 3.4M2. When switching to full screen mode, a floated button is shown which switchs back to the normal mode if pressed.
	Scrollable task pane. Task pane is scrolled when needed.
	"Online Help" menu item added under Help menu to open Zekr online wiki in a browser.
	A Help menu item added under search scope menu (near search button).
	Synchronize button removed in order to free more space in nav bar. This old button (from 0.1.0b1 :)) was rarely used.
	A new option added to General tab to show sura names in a tree-like structure. When selecting this mode,
	New language pack: Spanish (Mahdi Reyes).
Bug fixes:
	Disabled "Save as..." button when HTML is served through HTTP server. Exporting pages without having HTTP server on, is not a good idea, because no image/JS/CSS resources can be accessed then.
	Audio > Play/Pause menu item text is now correctly updated upon play/pause status change.
	Player bar buttons' size fixed.
	Audio menu is now correctly disabled when setting audio.enable = false in config.properties
	Separator is shown in "Recitation" and "Translation" menu groups when there is at least one recitation/translation available.
	All "Control" keys in menu item's accelerator (and text) changed to Command button.
	A bug with multi-translation layout fixed. This bug affected IE and caused horizontal scrolling when resizing window.
	Incorrect start point for Juz 10 fixed. The correct location is 8:41.
	When focusing on the first aya in each sura, there would be no extra space on the top of the focusing area, so that sura name and Bismillah are shown correctly.
	audio.enabled changed to audio.enable for more consistency in property naming.
	quran_detailedTextFile changed to quran_uthmaniTextFile in theme.properties.
	theme.properties in user workspace is overwritten with the base one if the base theme.properties is newer that user's. This resets all theme-related configurations when installing a newer version of Zekr.

Version 0.7.0 beta 2 - [24-8-08]
Features/Enhancements:
	Show the meaning of bismillah in be beginning of each sura in translation.
	Upgrade:
		- Lunuce x.y.z
		- Tanzil Quran text file 1.0.2
		- SWT 3.4.0
		- commons-logging, commons-configurations, commons-io, commons-lang, commons-codec
	Support paging:
		- Four built-in paging data introduced: Sura, Juz, Hizb quarter, Constant aya. As a result a new menu item (paging mode) introduced.
		- New add-on: paging data pack. *.page.xml files in res/text/metadata are used to introduce new paging data. An Uthmani paging is by default supported (uthmani.page.xml).
		- User may choose View > Paging Mode > Custom... in order to utilize a custom paging data available in (res/text/metadata/*.page.xml).
		- Navigation bar now accepts page as well as sura-aya pair. If page differs from the current page, it just navigates to the beginning of that page, otherwise it navigates to the entered sura-aya location.
		- Navigation buttons in work pane navigate through pages and ayas instead of suras and ayas. For example the button previously was for Next Sura, now navigates to the next page (if default paging mode is sura, it goes to the next sura).
	New config properties introduced: index.quran.path, index.quran.version, index.trans.path.<translation id>, and index.trans.version.<translation id>. properties. index.[quran|trans].path.[<translation id>] holds quran or a translation index location (identified with <translation id>), and index.[quran|trans].version.[<translation id>] is for Zekr build number which creates that index. Indexes created with different versions of Zekr may not be generally compatible, so it should reindex on each version (build number) update.
	New menu group added: View > Panel, in order to show and hide different panels. For now sura detail panel can be toggled. The state of a panel visibility is persisted under view.panel.<panel id> in config.properties.
	A few more progress point added for startup splash screen. A progress now increases startup progress bar value by 7%.
	Search metadata support:
		- Search metadata contains language-specific replace patterns for non-searchable or equivalent characters. It also has a list of stopwords, which is used to ignore those words for indexing.
		- A new class SearchInfo (metadata) introduced
		- A new config file res/config/search-info.properties added. This config file is included in main config.properties.
	Translation search:
		- Basic search support. It uses pattern replacements provided in search-info.properties.
		- Advanced search support. It uses pattern replacements provided in search-info.properties, or built-in Lucene analyzers if available for that language. 
	All 'View > Go To' menu items moved to a new global Menu: Go To. Random Aya also moved to this new menu.
	Two backups for zekr.log are kept: log4j.appender.RUNTIME.MaxBackupIndex=2.
	Update site URL moved from config.properties to version.properties. It's a security risk to have the URL inside user config.
	Root database:
		- A new configuration property: "root.enabled". One can disabled root database, because it's somewhat memory consuming.
		- All the Quran roots (indexed by root itself), and reverse index for roots of a single aya are loaded from res/text/metadata/quran-root.txt.
		- Search through Quran roots.
		- Sort results by: 1. Natural order, 2. Similarity, 3. Revelation order, and 4. Aya length.
		- Sort order: ascending and descending.
		- Set search scope for limiting root search results.
	Add support to index transltion data through command line (-index option).
	Goto Next/prev hizb quarter shortcut changed to Ctrl+Alt+Right/Left.
	Indicative icons added near each translation item in the menu, to showing if a translation is signed, unknown (not loaded), or unsigned.
	New language pack: hebrew.xml (Yotam Benshalom).
Bug fixes:
	A bug with basic search fixed, which happened when a whole clause was found at the end of an aya.
	Menu icons are not shown anymore in Mac.
	Major and minor sajda replaced with "mandatory" and "recommended" sajda.
	An incompatibility issue resolved which caused sura.vm not work with Velocity 1.5. Thanks for Serkan Kaba's patch.
	When an SWT Tree is set as SWT.SINGLE, it's selection listener is once called upon its first selection (which is selected by system). It caused aya not to be selected correctly in aya selection combo. A small but of checking (if (e.time > 0)) added to tree selection adapter in order to ignore its first systemy selection.
	A bug with unloading (TranslationData.unload()) currently in use translations, when multi-translation layout was selected is fixed. Since it mistakenly unload a translation which was in use, Zekr gave NPE errors for accessing translation of ayas.
	Just one thread is started for HTTP server. It used to start two separate thread, one of them was redundant.
	Manually focusing on an aya in the page during playing a recitation causes to recite that aya after current one (previously ignored the focusing aya).
	Fixed a bug with basic (tanzil) search highlighter. Search result was not highlighted correctly two or more phrases entered in the query, and at least one phrase (other than the first one) was exclusive (leaded with '-').
	Use StringUtils.isBlank() instead of isEmpty(). isBlank() also trims the input string.
	Change quran.text.delim to \\r\\n (Tanzil text files are in Windows line delimiter model).
	Remove extra whitespaces for search result ayas. Extra whitespaces caused non-elegant highlighted results.

Version 0.7.0 (Zekr Ramadan Edition 2) - [1-9-08]
Features/Enhancements:
	Ctrl+F focuses on the visible search box.
	A new stand-alone bookmarking feature: Bookmark This Aya. This feature is available through Ctrl+D, or Bookmarks > Bookmark This Aya menu item. It adds a default title to the bookmark item (based on the current aya) as well as the current Quran location to it.
Bug fixes:
	Changed the way quran-root is loaded. It was incompatible with GCJ.
	An error message box is now shown when indexing error occurs. User indexing cancellation is not assumed as an error.
	Show the correct bookmark references to an aya. It was looking for an incorrect Quran location since last beta release.
	A bug with toggling full screen fixed. It caused application to remain in full screen mode, even after pressing again Toggle full menu item.

Version 0.7.1 - [6-9-08]
Features/Enhancements:
	A new buffering (pre-fetching) scheme is used to avoid lags between reciting two ayas. This is done using a hidden flash player, which pre-fetches and loads the next aya.
	Added or updated some language packs and localized sura names (quran-properties-he.xml, russian.xml, spanish.xml, german.xml, arabic.xml, persian.xml
	Windows installer script changed to support smart deletion when uninstalling the software. It now logs installed files, and so does not delete files which are changed or added after installation.
Bug fixes:
	A blocker bug which prevents Zekr starting fixed. It happened when the user disabled audio support through Tools > Options menu.
	A bug fixed with sending flash JavaScript events to a browser without any flash player. This happened when separate layout is selected (in which flash player is loaded in the translation browser).
	A bug fixed which caused menu icons being shown in Mac when toggling play-pause state of the player. Icons are not shown intentionally in Mac.

Version 0.7.5 beta 1 - [31-10-09]
Features/Enhancements:
	A cache manager added for audio files. In future releases this cache is used to store up to x megabytes of downloaded online audios.
	Adding new recitation file (.properties) will not need a restart anymore.
	New audio player scheme introduced:

		- Added repeating support for a single aya. One may set to hear each aya twice or more.
		- Added interval (wait) support. One may wait up to x seconds after playing each aya. This is helpful for studying purposes.
		- There is no need anymore to an embedde HTTP server. It's removed with the new player scheme.
		- Playlists are removed. There is no need to such pains with the new player scheme.
		- Recitation files (.properties files) are totally changed. It's not backward compatible, so users have to download and install newer versions of recitation files (just .properties file, not the whole offline package of mp3s).
		- Supports playing special items (audhubillah, bismillah, sadaghallah) if recitation pack has anything.
	Added support for proxy (as a result, Zekr requires Java 1.5.0+ from this version). All network accesses are now done through NetworkController class.
	Added update.enableMenu property. This makes update menu disabled/enabled. Old update.enable is kept only for enabling or disabling auto check for update.
	Supporting new audio formats is a matter of adding required service provider interface (SPI) to the classpath. In Zekr base package the following types are supported by default (plus types with built-in supported by user's JRE):
		- MP3 (MPEG1 and MPEG2, Layer I-III): using these libraries: tritonus-share, jlayer and mp3spi.
		- OGG: using these libraries: tritonus-share, jorbis and vorbisspi.
		- SPEEX: using this library: jspeex.
	Shows localized recitater name (if available in recitation properties file).

	Recitations are sorted based on ID.
	Added Bulgarian language pack (submitted by Hamdi Sevitin).
	Added indonesian quran-properties-id.xml (submitted by abu0hasan).

	New images and icons designed for Windows installer.
Bug fixes:
	language pack ID and Quran metadata for Hebrew updated to have hw ISO code instead of deprecated he ISO code.
	quran-properties-ba => quran-properties-bs
	Added translation and themes are filtered with *.zip in Mac OSX, since it's open file dialog doesn't support double extension filtering (*.trans.zip).
	Bookmark is saved to the disk as soon as it's quick bookmarked (Ctrl+D).
	Auto-check for update is now disabled by default.
	A blocker bug with Velocity 1.6.x+ fixed.
	Bug 2631242: Uthmani text could not be enabled by setting quran_uthmaniTextFile to true.
	A bug fixed with uthmani.page.xml, which caused last sura (114) to have 5 ayas instead of 6 ayas.

Version 0.7.5 beta 2 - [07-11-09]
Features/Enhancements:
	A file is added to <zekr installation>/res/config/install.properties which holds installer path. This can be accessed through GlobalConfig.ZEKR_INSTALL_DIR, which is used to replace <installdir> variable in recitation files.
	Added recitation converter. Old recitations are converted to new format on startup. Old files are then moved to old-recitation-files folder.
	QuranWriterFilter now put some special characters in filtered Uthmani text for better rendering. A tatweel or a zwnj is put before small superscript alef according to the context.
	Added a new property text.filter.noSpaceBeforeWaqf to specify whether or not insert a space before waqf marks or not.
	Custom shortcuts are supported for certain menu items.
		- Class QuranFormController added with a method registerAction(methodName) to ease this process.
		- If the menu selection action is registered (registeration is done by default for all menu items to which key accelerators were bound),
			it is possible to bind accelerator through file res/config/shortcut.xml. This file contains a set of keyboard shortcuts for menu actions
			which can be customized based on UI direction (RTL or LTR). Almost all key combinations can be used.
		- File shortcut.xml is copied to user workspace if not available there. If Zekr version of shortcut.xml doesn't match with user's shortcut.xml, Zekr loads users file and adds new entries added to main shortcut.xml.
	Added two menu items under Audio menu: next aya, previous aya. These commands reserve playing state.
	Updated to SWT 3.6.0M3.

	Changed startup text. Zekr doesn't show version on startup splash screen anymore.
	Show tooptip on audio player panel (useful when text exceeds the normal panel size).
	Added F1 accelerator to Help > Online Help.

	Highlighter format can be customized through these properties: view.search.highlightFormat (advanced search and root search) or view.search.regexHighlightFormat (simple search).
	Added property search.maxResult as a higher limit for search result items.
	Added name localization support to revelation packs.
	audio.name property is no longer used in recitation packs. This was a duplication of audio.reciter.

		- goto.focus property to save last focused box of Goto form.
Bug fixes:
	A bug with opening multi translation customization form fixed.

Version 0.7.5 beta 4 - [19-02-10]
Features/Enhancements:
	Kasra+Shadda order is reversed in order to handle classic font rendering issue of kasra over a word and under shadda. This is done only when simple quran text (non-uthmani) is selected.
	Added Tamil language pack, thanks to Ahamed Saifudeen.
	A number of audio player enhancements:
		- Added a new pre-fetching mechanism for audio files. Based on the value of property: audio.cache.prefetcher, a few of the next Quran locations are just open()ed. This will boost playing speed for online recitations.
		- Added progress bar to audio player form to show playing progress. This only shows progress for offline recitations because of the limitation of the underlying audio engine.
		- Added seek support to audio player. If this is an offline recitation and seek is supported for the current playing engine, clicking on a part of the player progress bar will seek to there.
		- Added two new shortcuts to increase/decrease player volume by 10% (Increase: Ctrl+=, Decrease: Ctrl+-).
		- Added two new shortcuts to seek forward or backward by 15%.
		- Added a popup menu to change current recitation pack by clicking on recitation link at the top of audio player form.
		- Added play scope popup menu to audio player form. These options are available: aya, sura, page, hizb quarter, juz and continuous. For example if aya is selected, only plays a single aya, and if page is selected, will play until last aya of this page is reached.
		- Added three modes for playing special items (audhubillah, bismillah and sadaghallah): always, smart, never.
			Audhubillah:
				1) smart: will be played only once the system is up as the first playing item.
				2) always: will be always played if current aya is 1 of any sura, or before playing the first item when system is up. If this item is selected, bismillah will act as 'always', and will be played after audhubillah in the first aya of a suras but sura 1 and 9.
				3) never: never plays this item.
			Bismillah:
				1) smart: will be played only when player automatically goes from the last aya of the previous sura to the first aya of this sura.
				2) always: will be always played if current aya is 1 of any sura but suras 1 and 9. Bismillah will be played after audhubillah (if any). Setting audhubillah to 'always' will force 'always' mode for bismillah.
				3) never: never plays this item.
			Sadaghallah:
				1) smart: will be only played after 114:6 is played and it's in a multi-aya playing mode (any playing mode other than 'aya').
				2) always: will always play sadaghallah after reaching end of this playing mode (only in multi aya playing modes).
				3) never: never plays this item.
	Added page selection to Goto form.
	Zekr now supports Application Menu for Cocoa Mac (under which About, Preferences and Quit are rendered).
	Added a new import for recitation packs. These are offline .recit.zip packages containing a recitation descriptor (recitation.properties) and all mp3s.
	In Goto form, when "Review" button is pressed, other inputs are synchronized with last focused input.
	A fully enhanced key-binding system:
		- Added three new attributes to shortcut.xml: window, suppressOnModal, and global. If suppressOnModal is true and
			the active form is modal, the key pressed is ignored. If current form ID exists in form IDs specified in
			comma-separated values of window attribute, action is performed. If not, it checks if this action command
			is global (global=true). If it is global, shortcut command takes place regardless of the active shell ID.
			If not, action may take place if current shell is QuranForm (form id is "QURAN_FORM_ID").
		- Actions may now take place globally regardless of the current active shell. For example one may bring up "bookmarkThis"
			command even if the current focus is on Audio Player form (because of the global="true" specified in bookmarkThis command).
		- Command button is treated same as Control button if property key.commandAndControlAreSame is true.
	Some icons grouped in separate folder under img/icon folder.
	Added version to search-info.properties file. This file will be overriden if updating Zekr to a newer version.
	Updated search-info.properties to escape Al-, El- or related prefixes in searches. This is specially helpful in GoTo form sura name lookup.
	Updated to commons-config-1.6.0. It's still compatible with 1.5.0 thought.
	Added an option tab for audio in order to set playing mode for special items (audhubillah, ...).
	A few icons of options form updated.
	Added Macedonian language pack, thanks to Bojan Jankuloski.
Bug fixes:
	Command is used instead of Ctrl in Mac.
	Removed menu icons for Cocoa (Mac). This was already removed for Carbon.
	Bug fix in logger. It now show the full stack trace (including cause) when some unexpected exception occurs.

Version 0.7.6 - [17-06-10]
Features/Enhancements:
	Updated quran-simple from tanzil "Simple" to "Simple Enhanced" version to ease reading.
	Added the following new patterns to search-info.properties:
		- Diacritics (search.pattern.diacr): a single regular expression to match all diacritics of a language. Diacritics are inserted after a language's letter range (with * regex operator) so that it matches possible texts with diacritics in the target search text.
		- Letter range (search.pattern.letter): a single regular expression to match all letters of a language. Letters are basic alphabet of a language, different from digits, marks and diacritics. Diacritics may be applied after each letter in order to search for possible strings with diacritics in the text.
		- Punctuation marks (search.pattern.punct): a single regular expression to match all punctuation marks of a language. \p{Punct} will match almost all European punctuations, and we should add more to this for non-European languages. This regex is used to insert before and after search keywords in order to work as a tokenizer (for example so that "salaam" search query matches text parts like: "salaam.").
	Added QueryParserFactory and a new property to config.properties: view.search.advanced.queryParser. We use QueryParser by default as AnalyzingQueryParser doesn't recognize leading wildcards. User may change it himself. As a result of introducing new query parsers, we have now a new dependency: Added a new dependency: lucene-misc contrib project. This dependency is only used when parsers other than QueryParser are used.
	Now supports punctuation removal in sura name filtering (in Goto dialog).
	We now set default audio player volume for search result player audio player.
	Search results are now filtered. As a result, KASRA+SHADDA order is reversed in the final output to help Arabic newbie readers.
	AudioCacheManagerTimerTask made inactive for now. It had no effect, as there was no offline caching for audio files.
Bug fixes:
	Search result showed: "Page 1 of 0" when no result found. It not shows Page 1 of 1.
	Fixed exception of Goto Form when invalid sura:aya combination entered in sura:aya box.
	In recitation .properties files: audio.offlineBismillam should be changed to audio.offlineBismillah. Both these values are not recognized by Zekr for backward compatibility.
	A bug in search caused Kasra+Shadda reverse ordering not to be recognized correctly.
	Do not accept sura numbers below 1 in nav bar.

	Prevent AudioPlayerForm to get out of view (some limitations are applied to its location).
	Show only language in translation list menu. Show the same info at multi-translation configuration form.

	A new exe launcher added: http://winrun4j.sourceforge.net. zekr.exe and zekrc.exe parameters can be configured through related .ini files.
Bug fixes:
	Save As button will now save search result if current view shows a search result.
	Changing between Block/Line-by-Line mode in Translation-only layout will now work.
	Save AudioPlayerForm new location as it closes. It now saves the new location before Zekr is closed (previously it wasn't saved when Zekr was closed and AudioPlayerForm was in open state).
